                        <p class="card-text">Tomorrow the second big project of my bootcamp course is due. I am pretty
                            impressed and excited with what we came up with. That being said, I can't believe how much
                            we have covered in the class, and how little of it I feel like I understand. It seems like I
                            haven't gotten a lot of what I should have by now.</p>
                        <p> One of the more negative people in my life said, "<i>Man</i>... computer programming doesn't
                            seem like something you want to take the firehose approach with." Four month's later, I get
                            what he meant (he's still an ass). It is an insane amount of material that we have covered.
                            It's hard not to buy
                            into the imposter syndrome at times. But today we deployed this <a
                                href=https://dry-journey-46038.herokuapp.com>game</a>.</p>
                        <p>I don't expect to make a fortune off of it, or really have anyone but friends and family even
                            see it. Those that do may find it basic and underwhelming. Yet, to think that 2 other
                            people and myself, who knew <i><b> absolutely nothing</b></i> about programming, wrote an
                            app using html,
                            css, javascript, jQuery, node.js, express, MySQL, Sequelize (ORM), Heroku, and Phaser (API)
                            allows me, at least for a moment, to duck out of the onslaught and
                            breathe. Four months ago I couldn't have told you what any one of those words meant. I am
                            far from an expert in any of them, let alone all of them. When the class is finished in
                            another 2 months I don't expect I will land a job with Google or NASA (...at least not right
                            away). However it's cool to say, "I made that." </p>
                        <p>Browsing through jr. developer job listings and internship applications immediately brings
                            back the overwhelming blast of that firehose again. "How will I ever learn this stuff as
                            well as I need to? I've never even heard of whatever language that position wants. Minimum 2
                            years required. When will I have time to make up those homework assignments I missed?"</p>
                        <p> That's it for the metaphor. I don't have any cute saying about how the water is going to
                            help me sprout into a great developer or anything. With time and dilligence I hope that I
                            get a great job and get to work on cool things for a living. At least it can't be worse than
                            sales.
